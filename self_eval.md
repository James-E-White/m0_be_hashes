# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section? Some of the syntax, was able to look over work and figure out errors fairly quickly.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes? I have gone over my notes and have made them more streamlined. I am taking the most notes when I can visually see the work being done. I am kinesthetic and visual.
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first? I try first than I go to google, than slack line a friend.
